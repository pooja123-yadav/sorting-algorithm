# Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
# This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

# In Bubble Sort algorithm:

# 1. traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
# 2. In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
# 3. This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

# Total no. of passes: n-1
# Total no. of comparisons: n*(n-1)/2 (n,n-1,n-2,n-3..................1 = n*(n-1)/2)

# Note:  It can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.
